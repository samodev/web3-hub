- Fork the repo
- Create a branch with name similar to what you are doing
- Work on the issue and once done make a pull request following pull request template

#### How to put my code in the folder:

Make a folder depicting what your smart contract or script is doing.
Put all files in that folder in a meaning full way. Add a readme in the folder with following details:

- Title
- Description of script or contract, etc
- Explaining how script or smart contract is built, modules name, tech stack, etc
- Steps to run the smart contract or script
- Screenshots of output of the script or smart contract(All outputs of smart contracts functions are not needed) You can refer this [Project_Details_Template.md](https://github.com/theblockchainchief/web3-hub/blob/main/Project_Details_Template.md)

Once your folder is ready put that in the blockchain folder in which this script runs or is made
For example, If you are making a NFT contract on ethereum 
- Go inside Ethereum Folder
- Make and Name the folder NFT-ERC721
- Put contract .sol files here(No Truffle, hardhat, etc files should be added)
- Add a readme as per [Project_Details_Template.md](https://github.com/theblockchainchief/web3-hub/blob/main/Project_Details_Template.md)
- Push and Make the PR
